    <h1>About my Hobby</h1>
    <p>What is the point of learning?</p>
    <p>The answer to this question is simple to me: The point of learning, personally, is to become someone that is better than who they were yesterday.</p>
    <p>'Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.' - Albert Einstein</p>
    <p>This is a website dedicated to displaying an age-old hobby of mine: Learning. Ever since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, I have and will continue to be interested in learning something and expanding my knowledge in a variety of subjects and aspects of life. Whether it be STEM, art, people, myself, sales, etc., I have made it a personal mission in life to learn everything that I can about, well, everything. I have chosen the path of full-stack web development because I believe it will allow me to wear the most hats, which is useful in today's rapidly changing world. It also allows me to learn more about myself and what I like and dislike.</p>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>This is a website dedicated to my hobby. Here you will find a collection of topics that I enjoy delving into!</p>
    
    Here are some of my favourite books: 
    <ul>
        
        <li>"1984" by George Orwell</li>
        <li>"The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
        <li>"A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
    <img src="../images/wallhaven-nrgpz7.jpg" alt="A distant planet.">

    <p>The stars. What more can I say? The idea that there is an untold number of stars and planets out there, "200 sextillions" of them!</p>
    <p>There are about the same number of stars in the observable universe as there are sand grains in all of Earth's beaches, according to astronomy.com. It's humbling to know that I can never be the center of the world, let alone the universe.</p>
    <h2>News</h2>
    <img src="../images/sabc%20news.jpg" alt="SABC news logo.">

    
    <p>The reason why this is here is quite self-explanatory. The common quote that "Knowledge is power" is even more apt given today's data-driven mindset. It makes all the more sense to learn.</p>
    <h2>Table of Interests</h2>
